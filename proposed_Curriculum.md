Master of Science / Doctorate in Relational Systems
[University Name] Graduate School



Program Overview
The Relational Systems Graduate Program trains students to understand, formalize, and extend the Unified Conceptual Framework / Grand Unified Tensor Theory (UCF/GUTT) — a rigorous model of existence built on the principle that relation is the essence of being.

Students will master the mathematics of Nested Relational Tensors (NRTs), learn to formally verify propositions and axioms, and integrate physics, computer science, and philosophy into a unified relational perspective.



This is more than a degree — it is the founding curriculum for an entirely new discipline, producing the world’s first generation of Relational Systems Theorists.



Degree Options
M.S. in Relational Systems – 2 years, coursework + capstone project
Ph.D. in Relational Systems – 4–6 years, coursework + dissertation

Completion of the following undergraduate courses (or demonstrable competency):

Formal Languages & Automata Theory

Vision:
To establish Relational Systems Theory as a mature academic discipline, recognized globally as a framework for solving the most difficult problems of the 21st century — from reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity to modeling complex social and economic systems.



Director’s Welcome
"Our mission is to train a new kind of thinker — one who sees connection where others see separation. You will not merely learn what is known. You will formalize, verify, and extend it. This program will challenge you to model reality itself, and in doing so, to help articulate the next great chapter of human understanding. Welcome to the Relational Systems Graduate Program — welcome to the frontier."
