  for a registered mark in a specific jurisdiction.

Allowed, Without Permission (Fair, Factual Use)
1) Accurate, nominative references to the project or publications (e.g., “This paper evaluates UCF/GUTT™…”).

   provided LICENSE and NOTICE are included.

   “UCF/GUTT is a trademark of Michael Fillippini. Used with permission / nominative fair use.”

Prohibited Without Written Permission
- Any commercial use, endorsements, sponsorships, or co-branding.
- Use in product names, company names, domain names, social handles, or app titles
  (e.g., “UCFGuttAnalytics”, “RelationalWayAI”, “ucfgutt.ai”).
- Modified, stylized, or confusingly similar variations of the marks or logos.
- Usage implying affiliation or official status (e.g., “official”, “certified”, “partner”).
- Creating logos/marks derived from or easily confused with Owner’s marks.

Logo Use
- Do not modify, recolor, crop, rotate, add effects, or place on low-contrast backgrounds.
- Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of the “U” in “UCF”.
- Minimum digital size: 120 px width. For print: 30 mm width. Only use Owner-supplied assets.

Naming & Domains
- Do not register domains, social handles, or package names that include or
  are confusingly similar to the marks.
- For community forks/tools, use a neutral name plus a descriptor, e.g., “Relational-Proofs-Toolkit for UCF/GUTT”
  (with nominative reference only in the description).

Style for Text References
- First and most prominent use: “UCF/GUTT™”.
- Subsequent uses in the same document may omit ™ for readability.
- Always treat marks as adjectives, followed by a generic noun when possible
  (e.g., “the UCF/GUTT™ framework”; avoid using the mark as a verb).

Quality & Goodwill
- Any permitted use must not disparage the Owner or the project, or mislead users.
- Owner may request corrective action or revoke permissions at any time.
