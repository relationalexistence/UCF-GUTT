# UCF/GUTT Organizational Network Analysis - DEMO VERSION

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a Demonstration Version

This software is provided for **evaluation purposes only**. It uses **simplified algorithms** to illustrate the concepts of UCF/GUTT relational analysis without exposing proprietary methods.

## Copyright Notice

The UCF/GUTT (Universal Connectivity Framework / Grand Unified Tensor Theory) mathematical framework is proprietary intellectual property developed over 60+ years of research.

## Demo Limitations

| Feature | Demo | Production |
|---------|------|------------|
| Conflict Detection | Basic (concept only) | Proprietary tensor analysis |
| Health Scoring | Simple linear | Calibrated multi-factor |
| Network Metrics | Basic centrality | Full tensor-based |
| Formal Verification | Not included | 100,000+ lines Coq |
| Predictive Modeling | Not included | Escalation prediction |
| Historical Analysis | Not included | Trend tracking |

## What This Demo Illustrates

- **Relational Ontology**: Relations as primary, entities as emergent
- **Multi-Channel Analysis**: Relationships have multiple dimensions
- **R_conflict Detection**: Mixed positive/negative signals
- **R_harmony Detection**: Aligned relationship patterns
- **Health Scoring**: Overall network health assessment

## Running the Demo

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```
