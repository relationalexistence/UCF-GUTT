  PROPOSITION 11: The Direction of Relation (DOR) Incorporates "Origin of Relation"
                  with Uni-Directional and Multi-Directional Components
  
  Definition: Within the "Relational System" (RS), the "Direction of Relation" (DOR) 
  not only specifies the flow of the relationship between entities but also incorporates 
  the concept of "Origin of Relation" (OOR). The OOR delineates the point from which 
  the relation originates, and the DOR can manifest as uni-directional (from origin to 
  target) or multi-directional (involving reciprocal interactions) components.

  PHILOSOPHICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
  
  - Origin is IMPLICIT in Direction structure
  - Unidirectional: Clear origin → target causation
  - Multi-directional: Network of reciprocal origins
  - Bidirectional: Symmetric - either can be origin
  - Origin is the STARTING POINT of relational flow
  - Complex directions COMPOSE from uni-directional components
  - Origin preserved even as flow patterns change
  
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  CONNECTION TO OTHER PROPOSITIONS:
  
  Builds on:
  - Prop 1: Universal connectivity
  - Prop 9: Optional attributes framework
  - Prop 10: Direction as optional attribute
  
  Supports:
  - Prop 12: Sensory mechanisms (origin of perception)
  - Prop 13+: Additional directional properties
  - Causality: Origin as causal source
  
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     - Origin = cause, Target = effect
     - Unidirectional = linear causation
     - Multi-directional = mutual causation
  
  2. Information Flow:
     - Origin = source, Target = destination
     - Unidirectional = broadcasting
     - Multi-directional = network communication
  
  3. Physics:
     - Origin = force source
     - Unidirectional = applied force
     - Bidirectional = action-reaction
  
  4. Graph Theory:
     - Origin = source vertex
     - Components = edges in directed graph
     - Multi-directional = hypergraph edges
  
  5. Social Networks:
     - Origin = initiator of interaction
     - Unidirectional = following/influence
     - Bidirectional = friendship
     - Multi-directional = group dynamics
