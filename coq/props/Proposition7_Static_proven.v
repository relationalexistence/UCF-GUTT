  PROPOSITION 7: Static in the Context of the Relational System Means No Changes
  
  Definition: In the context of the Relational System (RS), "static" refers to 
  attributes or relations that do not change over time. These unchanging elements 
  within the Relational Tensors remain constant and stable within the RS.
