## Overview

This proof formalizes **division by zero as a relational boundary operator** with **bidirectional characterization theorems**. It extends the basic framework with complete logical characterizations and proves that boundary detection is **exact** (if and only if conditions).

**Core Achievement:** Complete characterization of relational boundaries with context-dependent interpretation.

**Key Innovation:** Proves **both directions**:
- Forward: `h(y) = 0` → `Boundary`
- Converse: `Boundary` → `h(y) = 0`
- Establishes: **Boundary ⟺ h(y) = 0** (exact equivalence)

## Relational States

### Type Definition

```coq
Inductive RelationalState :=
  | Related     (* Well-defined relation exists *)
  | Boundary    (* Relational boundary encountered *)
  | Undefined.  (* Total uncertainty/non-relation *)
```

**Three fundamental states:**

| State | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Related** | Denominator ≠ 0 | Normal function evaluation |
| **Boundary** | Denominator = 0 | Division by zero point |
| **Undefined** | Maximum uncertainty | True singularity |

**Key distinction:** `Boundary` ≠ `Undefined`
- **Boundary:** Structured transition (interpretable)
- **Undefined:** Complete absence of relation (non-interpretable)

---

## Domain Setup

### Parameters

```coq
Parameter X Y : Type.
Parameter g : X -> R.
Parameter h : Y -> R.
```

**Generic relation:** `f(x,y) = g(x) / h(y)`

**Parameterization:**
- `X`, `Y`: Arbitrary domain types
- `g`: Numerator function (X → ℝ)
- `h`: Denominator function (Y → ℝ)

**Applicability:** Works for any real-valued functions on any domains.

## Relational Boundary Detector

### Definition

```coq
Definition RelationalBoundary (x : X) (y : Y) : RelationalState :=
  let denom := h y in
  match Rlt_dec denom 0 with
  | left _ => Related              (* denom < 0 *)
  | right _ =>
      match Rgt_dec denom 0 with
      | left _ => Related          (* denom > 0 *)
      | right _ => Boundary        (* denom = 0 *)
      end
  end.
```

**Decision procedure:**
1. Check if `h(y) < 0` → If yes: `Related`
2. Else check if `h(y) > 0` → If yes: `Related`
3. Else (neither < nor >): `Boundary`

**Trichotomy on reals:** Every real number is either `< 0`, `= 0`, or `> 0`.

**Result:** Decidable detection of boundary condition.

---

## Context Types

### Definition

```coq
Inductive Context :=
  | Space   (* Spatial/geometric context *)
  | Time    (* Temporal context *)
  | Info.   (* Information-theoretic context *)
```

**Three interpretive contexts** for boundary resolution.

---

## Contextual Boundary Operator

### Definition

```coq
Definition ContextualBoundary (ctx : Context) (x : X) (y : Y) : RelationalState :=
  match RelationalBoundary x y with
  | Related => Related
  | Boundary =>
      match ctx with
      | Space => Related    (* Expansion/creation *)
      | Time  => Related    (* Collapse/reset *)
      | Info  => Undefined  (* Information loss *)
      end
  | Undefined => Undefined
  end.
```

**Interpretation table:**

| Base State | Context | Result | Physical Interpretation |
|------------|---------|--------|------------------------|
| Related | Any | Related | No boundary (normal operation) |
| Boundary | Space | Related | Emergent expansion (Big Bang) |
| Boundary | Time | Related | Temporal collapse (event horizon) |
| Boundary | Info | Undefined | True singularity (information loss) |
| Undefined | Any | Undefined | Propagates non-relation |

---

## Main Theorems

### Theorem 1: Boundary Detection (Forward)

```coq
Theorem boundary_on_zero : 
  forall (x : X) (y : Y), 
    h y = 0 -> RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary.
Proof.
  intros x y H_hy0.
  unfold RelationalBoundary.
  rewrite H_hy0.
  simpl.
  destruct (Rlt_dec 0 0) as [Hlt | Hnlt].
  - (* Case: 0 < 0 - impossible *)
    exfalso. lra.
  - (* Case: ¬(0 < 0) *)
    destruct (Rgt_dec 0 0) as [Hgt | Hngt].
    -- (* Case: 0 > 0 - impossible *)
       exfalso. lra.
    -- (* Case: ¬(0 > 0) - only possible path *)
       reflexivity.
Qed.
```

**Forward direction:** Zero denominator → Boundary state

**Proof strategy:**
1. Substitute `h(y) = 0`
2. Case analysis on `0 < 0`: Contradiction (proven by lra)
3. Case analysis on `0 > 0`: Contradiction (proven by lra)
4. Only remaining case: `Boundary` ✓

---

### Theorem 2: Boundary Detection (Converse)

```coq
Theorem zero_on_boundary : 
  forall x y,
    RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary -> h y = 0.
Proof.
  intros x y Hb; unfold RelationalBoundary in Hb.
  remember (h y) as d.
  destruct (Rlt_dec d 0) as [dlt|dnlt]; [discriminate|].
  destruct (Rgt_dec d 0) as [dgt|dngt]; [discriminate|].
  destruct (Rtotal_order d 0) as [Hlt|[Heq|Hgt]]; try lra; subst; reflexivity.
Qed.
```

**Converse direction:** Boundary state → Zero denominator

**Proof strategy:**
1. Assume `RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary`
2. If `d < 0`: Then result is `Related`, contradicts assumption (discriminate)
3. If `d > 0`: Then result is `Related`, contradicts assumption (discriminate)
4. Only way to get `Boundary`: Neither `< 0` nor `> 0`
5. By trichotomy: Must be `d = 0` ✓

**Key insight:** Boundary state is **only produced** when denominator is exactly zero.

---

### Theorem 3: Exact Characterization

```coq
Corollary boundary_iff_zero : 
  forall x y,
    RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary <-> h y = 0.
Proof. 
  split; [apply zero_on_boundary|apply boundary_on_zero]. 
Qed.
```

**Bidirectional equivalence:** 
```
RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary  ⟺  h y = 0
```

**Significance:** Boundary detection is **exact** - no false positives or false negatives.

---

### Theorem 4: Related Characterization

```coq
Theorem related_iff_nonzero : 
  forall x y,
    RelationalBoundary x y = Related <-> h y <> 0.
Proof.
  intros x y; split.
  - intro H; unfold RelationalBoundary in H.
    remember (h y) as d.
    destruct (Rlt_dec d 0) as [|Hnlt]; [lra|].
    destruct (Rgt_dec d 0) as [|Hngt]; [lra|discriminate].
  - intro Hnz; unfold RelationalBoundary.
    destruct (Rtotal_order (h y) 0) as [Hlt|[Heq|Hgt]]; try (now left).
    + destruct (Rlt_dec (h y) 0); [reflexivity|lra].
    + contradiction.
    + destruct (Rlt_dec (h y) 0); [lra|].
      destruct (Rgt_dec (h y) 0); [reflexivity|lra].
Qed.
```

**Related characterization:**
```
RelationalBoundary x y = Related  ⟺  h y ≠ 0
```

**Logical completeness:** Detector partitions into exactly two cases:
- `Boundary` ⟺ `h y = 0`
- `Related` ⟺ `h y ≠ 0`

---

### Theorem 5: Detector Never Undefined

```coq
Theorem detector_never_undefined : 
  forall x y,
    RelationalBoundary x y <> Undefined.
Proof.
  intros x y H.
  unfold RelationalBoundary in H.
  destruct (Rlt_dec (h y) 0) as [_|_].
  - (* Related case *) discriminate H.
  - destruct (Rgt_dec (h y) 0) as [_|_].
    + (* Related case *) discriminate H.
    + (* Boundary case *) discriminate H.
Qed.
```

**Detector soundness:** `RelationalBoundary` **never produces** `Undefined`.

**Type signature constraint:** Detector returns only `Related` or `Boundary`.

**`Undefined` is reserved** for contextual interpretation (Info context).

---

## Context-Specific Theorems

### Space Context Preservation

```coq
Theorem contextual_space_preserves_relation : 
  forall (x : X) (y : Y), 
    h y = 0 -> ContextualBoundary Space x y = Related.
Proof.
  intros x y H_hy0.
  unfold ContextualBoundary.
  assert (H_boundary : RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary).
  { apply boundary_on_zero. assumption. }
  rewrite H_boundary.
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```

**Space context:** Boundaries resolve to `Related`

**Physical interpretation:** Spatial boundaries → expansion (e.g., Big Bang).

---

### Time Context Preservation

```coq
Theorem contextual_time_preserves_relation : 
  forall (x : X) (y : Y), 
    h y = 0 -> ContextualBoundary Time x y = Related.
Proof.
  intros x y H_hy0.
  unfold ContextualBoundary.
  rewrite (boundary_on_zero x y H_hy0).
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```

**Time context:** Boundaries resolve to `Related`

**Physical interpretation:** Temporal boundaries → collapse/reset (e.g., event horizon).

---

### Info Context Collapse

```coq
Theorem contextual_info_collapses_relation : 
  forall (x : X) (y : Y), 
    h y = 0 -> ContextualBoundary Info x y = Undefined.
Proof.
  intros x y H_hy0.
  unfold ContextualBoundary.
  rewrite (boundary_on_zero x y H_hy0).
  simpl.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```

**Info context:** Boundaries collapse to `Undefined`

**Physical interpretation:** Information loss → true singularity (non-relational).

---

## Logical Structure

### Complete Partition

**Detector creates binary partition:**
```
All (x, y) pairs
    ├─ h(y) = 0   → Boundary
    └─ h(y) ≠ 0   → Related
```

**Exhaustive:** Every pair classified.  
**Exclusive:** No overlap between classes.

---

### Decidability

**Boundary detection is decidable:**
- Uses `Rlt_dec` and `Rgt_dec` (decidable real comparisons)
- Constructive: Gives explicit answer (not just existence)
- Computable: Can be extracted to OCaml/Haskell

---

### Context Resolution

**Two-stage process:**

```
Stage 1: Detect boundary
  Input: (x, y)
  Output: Related | Boundary

Stage 2: Contextual interpretation
  Input: (Result from Stage 1) × Context
  Output: Related | Undefined
```

**Separation of concerns:**
- **Detection** (mathematical): Is there a boundary?
- **Interpretation** (physical): What does boundary mean?

---

## Comparison with DivisionbyZero_proven

### Similarities

Both proofs:
- Define `RelationalState` type
- Define `RelationalBoundary` detector
- Define `Context` types
- Prove forward direction: `h = 0` → `Boundary`
- Prove context-specific resolutions

### Differences (This proof adds)

| Feature | DivisionbyZero_proven | boundary_division |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Converse theorem** | ❌ Not included | ✅ `zero_on_boundary` |
| **Iff characterization** | ❌ Not included | ✅ `boundary_iff_zero` |
| **Related characterization** | ❌ Not included | ✅ `related_iff_nonzero` |
| **Detector soundness** | ❌ Not included | ✅ `detector_never_undefined` |
| **Bidirectional proof** | ❌ Forward only | ✅ Both directions |

**This proof is more complete** - establishes exact logical equivalences.

---

## Philosophical Implications

### 1. Boundaries Are Exact

**Not fuzzy or approximate** - boundary condition is **precisely** `h(y) = 0`.

**Mathematical necessity:** No ambiguity about when boundary occurs.

---

### 2. Detection vs. Interpretation

**Two-stage process:**
1. **Detection** (objective): Mathematical condition (`h = 0`)
2. **Interpretation** (contextual): Physical meaning (Space/Time/Info)

**Detection is context-independent** - boundary exists regardless of interpretation.

---

### 3. Context Determines Ontology

**Same mathematical condition** (`h = 0`) has different ontological status:
- **Space:** New relations emerge (expansion)
- **Time:** Relations reset (collapse)
- **Info:** Relations cease (singularity)

**Relationality is context-dependent.**

---

### 4. Undefined vs. Boundary

**Two distinct forms of non-relation:**
- **Boundary:** Structured transition (at the edge)
- **Undefined:** Fundamental absence (beyond the edge)

**Boundary can be interpreted** (Space/Time → Related)  
**Undefined cannot** (propagates as non-relation)

---

### 5. Decidability of Boundaries

**Relational boundaries are decidable** - can be detected algorithmically.

**Contrast with:**
- Mathematical singularities (may require limits)
- Physical singularities (may be unobservable)
- Computational singularities (may be undecidable)

**UCF/GUTT boundaries:** Clean, decidable, exact.

---

- At `r = r_s`: Boundary detected
- Time context: Interpreted as collapse (Related)

---

### Information Theory

- At `ω = 0`: Boundary detected
- Space context: Fluctuations persist (Related)

---

## FAQ

**Q: Why both forward and converse theorems?**  
A: Forward shows sufficiency (`h = 0` is enough for boundary). Converse shows necessity (`h = 0` is required for boundary). Together: **exact characterization**.

**Q: Can detector produce Undefined?**  
A: No - `detector_never_undefined` proves this. `Undefined` only comes from Info context interpretation.

**Q: Is detection computable?**  
A: Yes - uses decidable real comparisons. Can be extracted to executable code.

**Q: What if h is not continuous?**  
A: Doesn't matter - detection only depends on point values, not continuity.

**Q: Can this handle complex-valued functions?**  
A: Current formalization uses reals. Extension to complex requires different zero detection (magnitude = 0).

**Q: What about limits approaching zero?**  
A: This formalization is **pointwise** - checks exact zero, not limits. Limit-based approach would be separate (and harder to prove).

---

## Future Extensions

**Possible additions:**
- Limit-based boundary detection (ε-δ formalism)
- Multi-variable boundaries (multiple denominators)
- Higher-order boundaries (derivatives vanish)
- Complex-valued boundaries (magnitude threshold)
- Fuzzy boundaries (degrees of boundary-ness)
- Probabilistic boundaries (stochastic denominators)
