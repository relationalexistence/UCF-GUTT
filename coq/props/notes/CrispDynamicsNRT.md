## Overview

This proof establishes the **crisp projector** (F∘U operator) and its properties for **nested relational tensors (NRT)**. The crisp projector extracts boolean structure from weighted relations, enabling discrete/continuous duality.

**Core Concept:** Every weighted relation has a "shadow" - its discrete, boolean essence obtained by thresholding. This projection is idempotent, respects symmetries, and composes naturally.

**Key Achievements:**
1. **Crisp Projector Theory:** Idempotent projection to boolean tensors
2. **Perfect Recovery:** U∘F = id (boolean → weighted → boolean is lossless)
3. **Dynamics Integration:** Coherent evolution under crisp projection
4. **NRT Nesting:** Compositional structure with symmetry preservation
5. **Parametric Polymorphism:** Generic over index sets and scalar fields

---

## Core Concepts

### Boolean vs Weighted Relations

```coq
Context {A B : Type}.  (* Parametric over index sets *)

Definition KRel := A -> B -> R.  (* Weighted: real-valued *)
Definition BoolRel := A -> B -> bool.  (* Boolean: 0/1 *)
```

**Two complementary views of relations:**

| Aspect | Weighted (KRel) | Boolean (BoolRel) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Values** | Real numbers ℝ | {true, false} |
| **Semantics** | Continuous strength | Discrete existence |
| **Information** | Rich (magnitudes) | Sparse (presence/absence) |
| **Use cases** | Measurements, probabilities | Logic, graph structure |

**Duality:** Neither is "more fundamental" - they're complementary projections of relational structure.

---

## Free/Forgetful Adjunction

### Forgetful Functor U (Threshold)

```coq
Definition U_thresh (t : KRel) : BoolRel :=
  fun x y => if Rlt_dec (/2)%R (t x y) then true else false.
```

**Thresholding at 1/2:** Forgets weight information
- `t(x,y) > 1/2` → `true` (edge exists)
- `t(x,y) ≤ 1/2` → `false` (no edge)

**Metaphor:** Looking at a grayscale image and asking "is this pixel bright or dark?" - loses all the shades of gray.

**Direction:** KRel → BoolRel (forgets structure)

---

### Free Functor F (Embed)

```coq
Definition F_embed (r : BoolRel) : KRel :=
  fun x y => if r x y then 1%R else 0%R.
```

**Minimal embedding:** Boolean to minimal weights
- `true` → `1.0` (minimal positive weight)
- `false` → `0.0` (no relation)

**Metaphor:** Taking a black-and-white image and saying "black = 0, white = 1" - adds minimal structure to represent the discrete information.

**Direction:** BoolRel → KRel (adds minimal structure)

---

## The Crisp Projector FU

### Definition and Intuition

```coq
Definition FU (t : KRel) : KRel := F_embed (U_thresh t).
```

**FU = F ∘ U:** Composite projection in two steps:

1. **U (Threshold):** Weighted → Boolean (collapse to discrete)
2. **F (Embed):** Boolean → Weighted (minimal re-enrichment)

**Effect:** Collapses continuous weights to discrete {0, 1} structure.

**Visual example:**
```
Original tensor:    [0.2  0.7  0.1  0.9]
After U (thresh):   [F    T    F    T  ]
After F (embed):    [0    1    0    1  ]
                     ↑________________↑
                     Crisp! Only 0 and 1
```

---

## Fundamental Property: U∘F = id

### Perfect Recovery Theorem

```coq
Lemma UoF_id_pt :
  forall (r : BoolRel) (x : A) (y : B),
    U_thresh (F_embed r) x y = r x y.
Proof.
  intros r x y. unfold U_thresh, F_embed.
  destruct (r x y) eqn:E; cbn.
  - destruct (Rlt_dec (/2)%R 1%R) as [H|H]; [reflexivity|]; exfalso; lra.
  - destruct (Rlt_dec (/2)%R 0%R) as [H|H]; [lra|reflexivity].
Qed.
```

**Key insight:** Boolean → Weighted → Boolean **recovers perfectly**.

**Why?**
- `true` → `1.0` → threshold at 1/2 → `true` ✓
- `false` → `0.0` → threshold at 1/2 → `false` ✓

**No information lost** because:
1. F embeds booleans at extreme values (0 and 1)
2. U's threshold (1/2) is between these extremes
3. Round trip is identity

---

### Function Equality Version

```coq
Lemma UoF_id_fun : 
  forall r : BoolRel, U_thresh (F_embed r) = r.
Proof.
  intros r.
  apply functional_extensionality; intro x.
  apply functional_extensionality; intro y.
  apply UoF_id_pt.
Qed.
```

**Extensionality:** Pointwise equality extends to function equality.

**Consequence:** U and F form a "near-adjunction" - perfect recovery in one direction.

---

## Crispness Characterization

### Definitions

```coq
Definition Crisp_fun (t : KRel) : Prop := exists r, t = F_embed r.
Definition Crisp_pt (t : KRel) : Prop := exists r, forall x y, t x y = F_embed r x y.
```

**Crisp tensor:** Takes only values in {0, 1}.

**Two formulations:**
- `Crisp_fun`: Tensor equals some embedding (function-level)
- `Crisp_pt`: Tensor equals embedding pointwise (pointwise)

Both are equivalent (via functional extensionality).

---

### Fixed Point Characterization

```coq
Lemma crisp_fun_iff_FU_fixed_fun :
  forall t, Crisp_fun t <-> FU t = t.
Proof.
  intro t; split.
  - intros [r Hr]. subst. unfold FU. now rewrite (UoF_id_fun r).
  - intro Hfix. exists (U_thresh t). unfold FU in Hfix. now symmetry.
Qed.
```

**Fundamental characterization:** `t` is crisp ↔ `FU(t) = t`

**Interpretation:**
- Crisp tensors are exactly the **fixed points** of FU
- If tensor is already 0/1, thresholding and re-embedding does nothing
- If tensor has intermediate values, FU changes it

**Category theory:** FU is a **projection operator** (retraction).

---

## Idempotence

### Main Theorem

```coq
Lemma FU_idempotent : 
  forall t, FU (FU t) = FU t.
Proof. 
  intro t. unfold FU. now rewrite (UoF_id_fun (U_thresh t)). 
Qed.
```

**FU ∘ FU = FU:** Applying crisp projection twice = applying it once.

**Proof idea:**
1. `FU t = F (U t)` by definition
2. `FU (FU t) = FU (F (U t))` = `F (U (F (U t)))`
3. `U (F (U t)) = U t` by U∘F = id
4. So `FU (FU t) = F (U t) = FU t` ✓

**Consequence:** FU is a **projection** - it finds the "crisp part" of any tensor.

**Analogy:** Taking a photo, converting to black-and-white, then converting to black-and-white again doesn't change it further. First conversion captures all the crispness there is.

---

## Boolean Values Theorem

```coq
Lemma FU_is_boolean : 
  forall t x y, FU t x y = 1%R \/ FU t x y = 0%R.
Proof.
  intros t x y. unfold FU, F_embed, U_thresh. cbn.
  destruct (Rlt_dec (/2)%R (t x y)); [left|right]; reflexivity.
Qed.
```

**Crisp tensors take only boolean values** - no intermediate weights.

**Consequence:** `FU(t)` is always crisp, regardless of whether `t` was crisp.

---

## Dynamics Integration

### Basic Evolution Operator

```coq
Section Dynamics.
  Context {A B : Type}.
  Variable a b e : A.  (* Designated elements *)
  
  Definition E (i : A) (T : KRel) : KRel :=
    fun x y => if eq_dec x i then FU T x y else T x y.
```

**Evolution operator E:** Applies crisp projection at designated index.

**Interpretation:**
- At entity `i`, apply crispification: `E(i, T)(i, y) = FU(T)(i, y)`
- Everywhere else, leave unchanged: `E(i, T)(x, y) = T(x, y)` for `x ≠ i`

**Physical metaphor:** "Measurement" at entity `i` collapses continuous amplitudes to discrete outcomes.

---

### Special Element Evolution

```coq
Lemma E_id : forall T, E e T = FU T.
Lemma Ehat_id : forall T, Ehat e T = FU T.
```

**Special element `e`:** Evolution at `e` reduces to global crispification.

**Interpretation:** Element `e` acts as a "universal observer" - measurement here affects everything.

---

## Symmetry and Group Actions

### Group Structure

```coq
Variable G : Type.  (* Group *)
Variable eG : G.  (* Identity *)
Variable inv : G -> G.  (* Inverse *)
Variable op : G -> G -> G.  (* Group operation *)

Variable actA : G -> A -> A.  (* Action on A *)
Variable actB : G -> B -> B.  (* Action on B *)

Hypothesis G_laws :
  forall g h k, op g (op h k) = op (op g h) k /\
                op eG g = g /\ op g eG = g /\
                op g (inv g) = eG /\ op (inv g) g = eG.
```

**Symmetry group:** Relabels indices while preserving structure.

**Examples:**
- Permutation group: rearranges indices
- Rotation group: rotates spatial indices
- Translation group: shifts positions

---

### Pushforward (Relabeling)

```coq
Definition push (g:G) (T:KRel) : KRel :=
  fun x y => T (actA (inv g) x) (actB (inv g) y).
```

**Pushforward:** Relabel tensor by group element `g`.

**Intuition:** 
- Original: `T(x, y)`
- After relabeling by `g`: `T(g⁻¹·x, g⁻¹·y)`

**Why inverse?** To make composition work correctly:
- `push(g, push(h, T)) = push(gh, T)`

---

### FU Equivariance

```coq
Hypothesis F_embed_equiv :
  forall g r, push g (F_embed r) = F_embed (push_bool g r).

Hypothesis U_thresh_equiv :
  forall g T, push g (U_thresh T) = U_thresh (push g T).

Lemma FU_equiv : 
  forall g T, push g (FU T) = FU (push g T).
Proof.
  intros g T. unfold FU. 
  rewrite F_embed_equiv, U_thresh_equiv. 
  reflexivity.
Qed.
```

**FU respects symmetries:** Crispification commutes with relabeling.

**Diagram:**
```
    T  --------FU-------->  FU(T)
    |                        |
push g                    push g
    |                        |
    v                        v
 push(g,T) ---FU---> FU(push(g,T))
```

**Philosophical:** Discretization doesn't arbitrarily break symmetries. Physical symmetries survive crispification.

---

## Nested Relational Tensors (NRT)

### Tensor Composition

```coq
Variable opT : KRel -> KRel -> KRel.  (* Tensor composition *)
Variable I : KRel.  (* Identity tensor *)

Hypothesis opT_assoc : forall X Y Z, opT X (opT Y Z) = opT (opT X Y) Z.
Hypothesis opT_I_l : forall X, opT I X = X.
Hypothesis opT_I_r : forall X, opT X I = X.
```

**Monoid structure:** Tensors form associative composition with identity.

**Examples of composition:**
- **Matrix multiplication:** Compose linear maps
- **Kronecker product:** Build higher-dimensional tensors
- **Relational composition:** Chain relationships
- **Convolution:** Combine spatial patterns

---

### Nested Structure (Recursive Composition)

```coq
Fixpoint nest (xs : list KRel) : KRel :=
  match xs with
  | nil => I
  | h::t => opT h (nest t)
  end.
```

**Nesting:** Compose list of tensors into single structure.

**Recursive definition:**
- Empty list → identity tensor
- Non-empty → compose head with nested tail

**Example:**
```
nest [T₁, T₂, T₃] = T₁ ⊗ (T₂ ⊗ T₃)
                  = (T₁ ⊗ T₂) ⊗ T₃  (by associativity)
```

**Enables:** Arbitrary depth hierarchies
- Level 1: Basic tensors
- Level 2: Compositions of basic tensors
- Level 3: Compositions of compositions
- ... (unbounded depth)

---

### Nest Equivariance

```coq
Hypothesis opT_equiv : 
  forall g X Y, push g (opT X Y) = opT (push g X) (push g Y).

Hypothesis I_equiv : 
  forall g, push g I = I.

Lemma nest_equiv : 
  forall g xs, push g (nest xs) = nest (map (push g) xs).
Proof.
  intros g xs; induction xs as [|h t IH]; cbn.
  - apply I_equiv.
  - now rewrite opT_equiv, IH.
Qed.
```

**Symmetries preserved through nesting** - group actions distribute over composition.

**Key insight:** Can relabel complex nested structure by relabeling components.

**Proof technique:** Structural induction on list of tensors.

---

### FU Distribution over Nesting

```coq
Hypothesis FU_morphism : 
  forall X Y, FU (opT X Y) = opT (FU X) (FU Y).

Hypothesis FU_I : 
  FU I = I.

Lemma FU_nest : 
  forall xs, FU (nest xs) = nest (map FU xs).
Proof.
  intro xs; induction xs as [|h t IH]; cbn.
  - now rewrite FU_I.
  - now rewrite FU_morphism, IH.
Qed.
```

**FU is a monoid morphism:** Crisp projection distributes over composition.

**Two ways to crispify nested structure:**
1. **Compose then crispify:** `FU(T₁ ⊗ T₂ ⊗ T₃)`
2. **Crispify then compose:** `FU(T₁) ⊗ FU(T₂) ⊗ FU(T₃)`

**They're equal!** Distributivity means order doesn't matter.

**Practical benefit:** Can crispify components independently, then compose.

---

### Compositional Crispness

```coq
Lemma nest_crisp_if_all_crisp :
  forall xs, (forall h, In h xs -> FU h = h) -> FU (nest xs) = nest xs.
Proof.
  intros xs Hall. rewrite FU_nest.
  apply nest_pointwise_eq.
  intros h Hin. now apply Hall.
Qed.
```

**If all components crisp, nesting is crisp.**

**Proof idea:**
1. By distribution: `FU(nest xs) = nest(map FU xs)`
2. Each component `h` satisfies `FU h = h` (given)
3. So `map FU xs = xs`
4. Therefore `FU(nest xs) = nest xs` ✓

**Compositional reasoning:** Boolean structure preserved under composition.

---

## Philosophical Implications

### 1. Discrete/Continuous Duality

**FU bridges two worlds:**
- **Continuous weights** (physical measurements, amplitudes)
- **Discrete structure** (logical relations, graph topology)

**Neither is fundamental** - both are projections of richer relational structure.

**Physics analogy:** 
- Wave function (continuous) ↔ measurement outcome (discrete)
- Classical field (continuous) ↔ particle detection (discrete)

**UCF/GUTT:** Relations transcend discrete/continuous dichotomy.

---

### 2. Information Asymmetry (Irreversibility)

**Perfect forgetting, lossy enrichment:**
- **U∘F = id:** Boolean → Weighted → Boolean is **lossless**
- **F∘U ≠ id:** Weighted → Boolean → Weighted **loses information**

**Example:**
```
Original: [0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9]
Threshold: [F, F, T, T]
Re-embed: [0, 0, 1, 1]
         ↑___________↑ Lost: exact magnitudes
```

**Philosophical:** 
- **Simplification is reversible** (if you remember the rule)
- **Coarse-graining is irreversible** (information genuinely lost)

**Physics connection:** Thermodynamic arrow of time, measurement collapse.

---

### 3. Symmetry Preservation

**Equivariance:** Discrete projection respects symmetries.

**Key theorem:** `push g (FU T) = FU (push g T)`

**Implication:** Discretization doesn't arbitrarily break physical symmetries.

**Example:**
- If original tensor has rotational symmetry
- Crispified tensor has same rotational symmetry
- Symmetries "survive" the projection

**Physics:** Conservation laws (from symmetries) preserved under crispification.

---

### 4. Compositional Structure

**NRT nesting:** Complex hierarchies built from simple components.

**Scalability:** Same operations work at all levels of nesting.

**Modularity:** Can reason about components independently, then compose.

**Software analogy:** Object-oriented composition - build complex objects from simple ones.

---

### 5. Idempotence and Stability

**FU² = FU:** Projection is stable.

**Interpretation:** 
- First application extracts crisp structure
- Further applications change nothing
- System reaches "fixed point"

**Physics:** Measurement collapse - second measurement doesn't change outcome.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Why threshold at 1/2 specifically?**  
A: Any threshold in (0,1) would work, but 1/2 has nice properties:
- Symmetric around 0 and 1
- Ensures U∘F = id (since F maps to 0 and 1)
- Natural "midpoint" decision boundary

**Q: What is the physical interpretation?**  
A: Relations can have continuous strengths (correlation, field amplitude, probability), but observations are often discrete (detected/not, exists/doesn't). FU formalizes this measurement-like discretization.

**Q: Why is idempotence important?**  
A: Multiple reasons:
- Ensures applying discretization multiple times doesn't keep changing structure
- Reaches stable "fixed point" 
- Characterizes crisp tensors as exactly the fixed points
- Analogous to quantum measurement collapse (idempotent)

**Q: What are NRTs used for?**  
A: Modeling hierarchical relational systems:
- **Chemistry:** Molecules (atoms → bonds → molecular orbitals → interactions)
- **Social networks:** People → relationships → communities → society
- **Neural networks:** Neurons → synapses → layers → networks
- **Physics:** Particles → interactions → fields → spacetime

**Q: Can this be extended to quantum systems?**  
A: Yes! Replace:
- ℝ (real numbers) → ℂ (complex numbers)
- Boolean → Projection operators in Hilbert space
- Threshold → Spectral projection
Result: Quantum measurement theory in relational framework

**Q: How does this relate to fuzzy logic?**  
A: Fuzzy logic keeps continuous truth values [0,1]. FU is the "crisp boundary" - it extracts classical (boolean) logic from fuzzy logic by thresholding. Can extend to fuzzy case by keeping threshold as parameter.

**Q: What about machine learning applications?**  
A: Direct applications:
- **Binarization:** Convert continuous weights to binary (0/1) networks
- **Quantization:** Discretize neural networks for efficiency
- **Attention mechanisms:** Threshold attention scores to sparse structure
- **Graph neural networks:** Extract discrete graph from continuous similarity

---

## Future Extensions

**Possible additions:**
- **Fuzzy integration:** Parametric threshold (not just 1/2)
- **Probabilistic thresholding:** Stochastic FU with noise
- **Quantum version:** Complex-valued tensors, projection operators
- **Higher categories:** Bicategories of nested tensors
- **Differential structure:** Smooth crispification with gradients
- **Topos theory:** Internal logic of relational categories
