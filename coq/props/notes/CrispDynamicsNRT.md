# CrispDynamicsNRT.v

This file formalizes the **Crisp Projector (FU)** together with **Dynamics** and **Nested Relational Tensor (NRT) Symmetry** in Coq.  
It is **self-contained**, requiring only standard Coq libraries:

- `Reals`
- `Lists.List`
- `micromega.Lra`
- `Logic.FunctionalExtensionality`

---

## Overview

The development builds a rigorous foundation for **crispization**, **time evolution**, and **symmetry-nested tensor composition**, providing a kernel for extending the **UCF/GUTT framework** inside Coq.

### Layers

1. **Crisp Projector (FU)**
   - Defines crispization: `FU := F_embed ∘ U_thresh`.
   - Proves:
     - Idempotence (`FU (FU t) = FU t`),
     - Fixed-point characterization (`FU t = t <-> t is crisp`),
     - Outputs are always Boolean (`0` or `1`).

2. **Dynamics Layer**
   - Introduces an abstract time monoid `(Time, comp, e)`.
   - Defines an evolution operator `E : Time -> KRel -> KRel`.
   - If `E` commutes with `FU`, then:
     - Crisp relations remain crisp (`crisp_invariant`).
     - The projected evolution `Ehat := FU ∘ E` inherits:
       - **Semigroup law** (`Ehat (comp a b) = Ehat a ∘ Ehat b`),
       - **Identity law** (`Ehat e = FU`).

3. **Symmetry + NRT Nesting**
   - Defines group actions `push : G -> KRel -> KRel` on relations.
   - Proves equivariance:
     - `FU` commutes with group action (`FU_equiv`).
     - Nesting (`nest`) is equivariant (`nest_equiv`).
   - Shows that crispization distributes over NRT composition:
     - `FU (nest xs) = nest (map FU xs)`.
   - Proves that if all factors are crisp, the entire nest is crisp.

## Main Theorems

- **Crisp Projector**
  - `FU_idempotent`: Crispization is stable under repetition.
  - `crisp_fun_iff_FU_fixed_fun`: Fixed points of `FU` are exactly crisp tensors.
  - `FU_is_boolean`: Crisp outputs are binary-valued.

- **Dynamics**
  - `crisp_invariant`: Crispness is preserved under compatible evolution.
  - `Ehat_semigroup`: Projected evolution is associative.
  - `Ehat_id`: The identity evolution reduces to `FU`.

- **Symmetry + NRT**
  - `FU_equiv`: Crispization respects group actions.
  - `nest_equiv`: Nesting is equivariant.
  - `FU_nest`: Crispization distributes over NRT nesting.
  - `nest_crisp_if_all_crisp`: If each component is crisp, the whole system is crisp.

---

## Implications

- **Mathematical**
  - Crispization defines an **idempotent projection** onto the Boolean subspace of real-valued relations.
  - Dynamics respecting `FU` guarantees **closure** of crisp states under time evolution.
  - Group equivariance ensures that **symmetries commute** with the act of crispization.
  - Nested relational tensors form a **compositional algebra** where crispness is preserved across levels.

- **Physical (UCF/GUTT context)**
  - Crispization corresponds to **quantization**: enforcing binary relational structure (e.g., presence/absence of relation).
  - Dynamics + crisp invariance mirrors **unitary evolution** that preserves quantized states.
  - Equivariance under group actions shows that **symmetry laws hold even after quantization**.
  - NRT nesting provides a rigorous framework for **building composite systems**, from particles to networks.

- **Philosophical**
  - The theorems confirm that **relation, once crisply defined, persists consistently across time and transformation**.
  - They reinforce the UCF/GUTT perspective: **reality is structured by relations**, not by externally imposed constructs.
  - This module is a seed: by proving closure, invariance, and compositionality, it opens a path to extending relational dynamics into **physics, computation, and logic**.

---

## Usage

This module provides a **rigorous kernel** for:

- **Quantization**: forcing relational tensors into Boolean structure.
- **Dynamics**: evolving crisp or non-crisp relations consistently.
- **Symmetry**: handling group actions and invariances.
- **Composition**: combining tensors into nested relational structures.

It can be used as:

- A starting point for **relational physics models**,
- A scaffold for extending to **probabilistic or gauge dynamics**,
- A standalone demonstration of **UCF/GUTT rigor in Coq**.
