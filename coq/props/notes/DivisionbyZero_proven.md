## Overview

This proof formalizes **division by zero as a relational boundary operator** rather than an undefined operation. The key insight: division by zero marks transitions between relational states, with interpretation depending on context (Space, Time, Information).

**Philosophical shift**
- **Traditional:** Division by zero = undefined = error  
- **Relational:** Division by zero = boundary = state transition

## Core Concept

### Relational States

```coq
Inductive RelationalState :=
| Related     (* relation exists; valid function evaluation *)
| Boundary    (* division by zero — relational boundary *)
| Undefined.  (* total uncertainty *)
Three states

Related: Normal relational state (denominator ≠ 0)

Boundary: Denominator = 0 (boundary condition)

Undefined: Complete absence of relation

Domain Setup
Type Parameters
coq
Copy code
Parameter X Y : Type.
Parameter g : X -> R.
Parameter h : Y -> R.
Generic domains

X: Source domain

Y: Target domain

g: Function on X

h: Function on Y (potential denominator)

Interpretation: g(x) / h(y) where h(y) might be zero.

Relational Boundary Operator
Definition
coq
Copy code
Definition RelationalBoundary (x : X) (y : Y) : RelationalState :=
  let denom := h y in
  match Rlt_dec denom 0 with
  | left _ => Related              (* denom < 0 *)
  | right _ =>
    match Rgt_dec denom 0 with
    | left _ => Related            (* denom > 0 *)
    | right _ => Boundary          (* denom = 0 *)
    end
  end.
Logic

If h(y) < 0: Related

If h(y) > 0: Related

If h(y) = 0: Boundary

(Uses decidable comparison on real numbers.)

Main Theorem: Boundary Detection
coq
Copy code
Theorem boundary_on_zero :
  forall (x : X) (y : Y),
    h y = 0 -> RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary.
Proof.
  intros x y H_hy0.
  unfold RelationalBoundary.
  rewrite H_hy0.
  simpl.
  (* Goal: match Rlt_dec 0 0 with ... end = Boundary *)
  destruct (Rlt_dec 0 0) as [Hlt | Hnlt].
  - exfalso. lra.  (* lra proves ¬(0 < 0) *)
  - destruct (Rgt_dec 0 0) as [Hgt | Hngt].
    + exfalso. lra. (* lra proves ¬(0 > 0) *)
    + reflexivity.
Qed.
Establishes: h(y) = 0 ⇒ Boundary state
Technique: Decidable case analysis + linear arithmetic (lra).

Contextual Interpretation
Context Types
coq
Copy code
Inductive Context :=
| Space  (* spatial/geometric context *)
| Time   (* temporal context *)
| Info.  (* information-theoretic context *)
Different contexts interpret boundaries differently.

Contextual Boundary Operator
coq
Copy code
Definition ContextualBoundary (ctx : Context) (x : X) (y : Y) : RelationalState :=
  match RelationalBoundary x y with
  | Related => Related
  | Boundary =>
      match ctx with
      | Space => Related    (* interpreted as emergent expansion *)
      | Time  => Related    (* interpreted as collapse/reset *)
      | Info  => Undefined  (* information loss = non-relational *)
      end
  | Undefined => Undefined
  end.
Interpretation Rules

Base State	Context	Result	Interpretation
Boundary	Space	Related	Emergent spatial expansion (e.g., Big Bang)
Boundary	Time	Related	Temporal collapse/reset (e.g., event horizon)
Boundary	Info	Undefined	Information loss (true singularity)
Related	Any	Related	No change
Undefined	Any	Undefined	Propagates

Context-Specific Theorems
Space Context: Preservation

  forall (x : X) (y : Y),
    h y = 0 -> ContextualBoundary Info x y = Undefined.
Proof.
  intros x y H_hy0.

    by (apply boundary_on_zero; assumption).
  rewrite H_boundary; reflexivity.
Qed.

Philosophical Implications
1) Boundaries Are Relational Transitions
Not errors—boundaries mark transitions between relational regimes.

Example (Cosmology): t = 0 (Big Bang): Division by zero in temporal coordinate
→ Space context: Interpreted as expansion (Related)
→ Not an error, but beginning of spatial relations

2) Context Determines Meaning
Same mathematical condition (h = 0) has different interpretations:

Space: Emergence of new relations (expansion)

Time: Collapse/reset of existing relations

Info: Loss of relational structure (singularity)

3) Undefined ≠ Boundary
Two distinct states:

Boundary: Structured transition (interpretable)

Undefined: Complete absence (non-relational)

4) Resolution of Classical Paradoxes
Traditional: 1/0 = undefined → paradox
Relational: 1/0 = boundary → context-dependent resolution

Physical Applications
Cosmology: Big Bang Singularity
c
Copy code
Definition big_bang_time (t : R) : R := 1 / t.
(* At t = 0: Boundary state *)
(* Space context: Interprets as expansion (Related) *)
Interpretation: Not a failure of physics, but transition to spatial expansion.

Black Holes: Event Horizon
coq
Copy code
Definition schwarzschild_radius (r : R) (r_s : R) : R := 1 / (r - r_s).
(* At r = r_s: Boundary state *)
(* Time context: Interprets as temporal collapse (Related) *)
Interpretation: Time/space coordinates swap roles — temporal boundary.

Information Theory: Channel Capacity
coq
Copy code
Definition channel_capacity (SNR : R) (bandwidth : R) : R :=
  ln (1 + SNR) / bandwidth.
(* At bandwidth = 0: Boundary state *)
(* Info context: Interprets as information loss (Undefined) *)
Interpretation: Zero bandwidth ⇒ no information transmission ⇒ true singularity.

Quantum Mechanics: Zero-Point Energy
coq
Copy code
Definition quantum_energy (h_bar omega : R) : R := h_bar * omega / 2.
(* At omega = 0: Boundary state *)
(* Space context: Zero-point fluctuations persist (Related) *)
Interpretation: Even at zero frequency, relational structure remains.

Mathematical Structure
Decidability
c
Copy code
Rlt_dec : forall r1 r2 : R, {r1 < r2} + {~ (r1 < r2)}.
Rgt_dec : forall r1 r2 : R, {r1 > r2} + {~ (r1 > r2)}.
Enables constructive case analysis on zero detection.

Trichotomy
For any real h:

h < 0 → Related

h > 0 → Related

h = 0 → Boundary

Exhaustive and mutually exclusive.

Proof Techniques
Decidable case analysis (Rlt_dec, Rgt_dec)

Linear arithmetic (lra) to rule out 0 < 0 and 0 > 0

Reflexivity after normalization

Assertion chaining via boundary_on_zero

FAQ
Q: Is this saying 1/0 = something?
A: No—it's saying the state at division by zero is a boundary, not a number.

Q: How does this differ from limits?
A: Limits approach the point; boundaries are at the singularity, with context determining interpretation.

Q: Can this resolve all singularities?
A: Not all—Info context still yields Undefined. Many physical singularities can be reinterpreted.

Q: What about 0/0?
A: Needs additional structure. Current formalization focuses on non-zero numerator.

Q: Is this physics or mathematics?
A: Both—mathematical formalization of a physical/philosophical insight about relational transitions.
