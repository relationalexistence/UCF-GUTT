## Overview

This proof formalizes **division by zero as a relational boundary operator** rather than an undefined operation. The key insight: division by zero marks transitions between relational states, with interpretation depending on context (Space, Time, Information).

**Philosophical Shift:**
- **Traditional:** Division by zero = undefined = error
- **Relational:** Division by zero = boundary = state transition

---

## Core Concept

### Relational States
```coqInductive RelationalState :=
| Related     (* relation exists, valid function evaluation )
| Boundary    ( division by zero — relational boundary )
| Undefined.  ( total uncertainty *)

**Three states:**
1. **Related:** Normal relational state (denominator ≠ 0)
2. **Boundary:** Denominator = 0 (boundary condition)
3. **Undefined:** Complete absence of relation

---

## Domain Setup

### Type Parameters
```coqParameter X Y : Type.
Parameter g : X -> R.
Parameter h : Y -> R.

**Generic domains:**
- X: Source domain
- Y: Target domain  
- g: Function on X
- h: Function on Y (potential denominator)

**Interpretation:** `g(x) / h(y)` where h(y) might be zero.

---

## Relational Boundary Operator

### Definition
```coqDefinition RelationalBoundary (x : X) (y : Y) : RelationalState :=
let denom := h y in
match Rlt_dec denom 0 with
| left _ => Related              (* denom < 0 )
| right _ =>
match Rgt_dec denom 0 with
| left _ => Related          ( denom > 0 )
| right _ => Boundary        ( denom = 0 *)
end
end.

**Logic:**
- If h(y) < 0: Related state (negative denominator)
- If h(y) > 0: Related state (positive denominator)
- If h(y) = 0: **Boundary state** (division by zero)

**Uses decidable comparison** on real numbers.

## Main Theorem: Boundary Detection
```coqTheorem boundary_on_zero :
forall (x : X) (y : Y),
h y = 0 -> RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary.
Proof.
intros x y H_hy0.
unfold RelationalBoundary.
rewrite H_hy0.
simpl.
(* Goal: match Rlt_dec 0 0 with ... end = Boundary *)
destruct (Rlt_dec 0 0) as [Hlt | Hnlt].

(* Case: 0 < 0 is assumed true — impossible )
exfalso. lra.  ( lra proves ¬(0 < 0) *)
(* Case: ¬(0 < 0) is true )
destruct (Rgt_dec 0 0) as [Hgt | Hngt].
-- ( Case: 0 > 0 is assumed true — impossible )
exfalso. lra.  ( lra proves ¬(0 > 0) )
-- ( Case: ¬(0 > 0) is true )
( Goal: Boundary = Boundary *)
reflexivity.
Qed.


**Establishes:** h(y) = 0 ⟺ Boundary state

**Proof technique:** Decidable case analysis + linear arithmetic (lra).

## Contextual Interpretation

### Context Types
```coqInductive Context :=
| Space  (* Spatial/geometric context )
| Time   ( Temporal context )
| Info.  ( Information-theoretic context *)

**Different contexts interpret boundaries differently.**

---

### Contextual Boundary Operator
```coqDefinition ContextualBoundary (ctx : Context) (x : X) (y : Y) : RelationalState :=
match RelationalBoundary x y with
| Related => Related
| Boundary =>
match ctx with
| Space => Related    (* interpreted as emergent expansion )
| Time => Related     ( interpreted as collapse/reset )
| Info => Undefined   ( information loss = non-relational *)
end
| Undefined => Undefined
end.

**Interpretation Rules:**

| Base State | Context | Result | Interpretation |
|------------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Boundary | Space | Related | Emergent spatial expansion (e.g., Big Bang) |
| Boundary | Time | Related | Temporal collapse/reset (e.g., event horizon) |
| Boundary | Info | Undefined | Information loss (true singularity) |
| Related | Any | Related | No change |
| Undefined | Any | Undefined | Propagates |

---

## Context-Specific Theorems

### Space Context: Preservation
```coqTheorem contextual_space_preserves :
forall (x : X) (y : Y),
h y = 0 -> ContextualBoundary Space x y = Related.
Proof.
intros x y H_hy0.
unfold ContextualBoundary.
assert (H_boundary : RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary).
{ apply boundary_on_zero. assumption. }
rewrite H_boundary.
simpl.
reflexivity.
Qed.

**Spatial boundaries resolve to Related state** - interpretation: expansion/creation.

---

### Time Context: Preservation
```coqTheorem contextual_time_preserves :
forall (x : X) (y : Y),
h y = 0 -> ContextualBoundary Time x y = Related.
Proof.
intros x y H_hy0.
unfold ContextualBoundary.
assert (H_boundary : RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary).
{ apply boundary_on_zero. assumption. }
rewrite H_boundary.
simpl.
reflexivity.
Qed.

**Temporal boundaries resolve to Related state** - interpretation: reset/collapse.

---

### Information Context: Collapse
```coqTheorem contextual_info_collapses :
forall (x : X) (y : Y),
h y = 0 -> ContextualBoundary Info x y = Undefined.
Proof.
intros x y H_hy0.
unfold ContextualBoundary.
assert (H_boundary : RelationalBoundary x y = Boundary).
{ apply boundary_on_zero. assumption. }
rewrite H_boundary.
simpl.
reflexivity.
Qed.

**Information boundaries collapse to Undefined** - interpretation: true singularity.

---

## Philosophical Implications

### 1. Boundaries Are Relational Transitions

**Not errors** - boundaries mark transitions between relational regimes.

**Example (Cosmology):**t = 0 (Big Bang): Division by zero in temporal coordinate
→ Space context: Interpreted as expansion (Related)
→ Not an error, but beginning of spatial relations

### 2. Context Determines Meaning

**Same mathematical condition (h=0) has different interpretations:**
- **Space:** Emergence of new relations (expansion)
- **Time:** Collapse/reset of existing relations
- **Info:** Loss of relational structure (singularity)

### 3. Undefined ≠ Boundary

**Two distinct states:**
- **Boundary:** Structured transition (interpretable)
- **Undefined:** Complete absence (non-relational)

### 4. Resolution of Classical Paradoxes

**Traditional view:** 1/0 = undefined → paradox  
**Relational view:** 1/0 = boundary → context-dependent resolution

---

## Physical Applications

### Cosmology: Big Bang Singularity
```coqDefinition big_bang_time (t : R) : R := 1 / t.(* At t = 0: Boundary state )
( Space context: Interprets as expansion (Related) *)

**Interpretation:** Not a failure of physics, but transition to spatial expansion.

---

### Black Holes: Event Horizon
```coqDefinition schwarzschild_radius (r : R) (r_s : R) : R := 1 / (r - r_s).(* At r = r_s: Boundary state )
( Time context: Interprets as temporal collapse (Related) *)

**Interpretation:** Time and space coordinates swap roles - temporal boundary.

---

### Information Theory: Channel Capacity
```coqDefinition channel_capacity (SNR : R) : R := log(1 + SNR) / bandwidth.(* At bandwidth = 0: Boundary state )
( Info context: Interprets as information loss (Undefined) *)

**Interpretation:** Zero bandwidth = no information transmission = true singularity.

---

### Quantum Mechanics: Zero-Point Energy
```coqDefinition quantum_energy (E : R) (h_bar : R) (omega : R) : R :=
h_bar * omega / 2.(* At omega = 0: Boundary state )
( Space context: Zero-point fluctuations persist (Related) *)

**Interpretation:** Even at zero frequency, relational structure remains.

---

## Mathematical Structure

### Decidability
```coq(* Real number comparison is decidable *)
Rlt_dec : forall r1 r2 : R, {r1 < r2} + {¬(r1 < r2)}
Rgt_dec : forall r1 r2 : R, {r1 > r2} + {¬(r1 > r2)}

**Enables constructive case analysis** on zero detection.

---

### Trichotomy

For any real h:
1. h < 0 → Related
2. h > 0 → Related  
3. h = 0 → Boundary

**Exhaustive and mutually exclusive.**

---

## Proof Techniques

1. **Decidable Case Analysis:** Pattern matching on `Rlt_dec`, `Rgt_dec`
2. **Linear Arithmetic (lra):** Proves impossibility of 0 < 0, 0 > 0
3. **Reflexivity:** Trivial equalities after case analysis
4. **Assertion Chaining:** Build intermediate boundary_on_zero result

---

## Usage Examples

### Detecting Boundaries
```coqRequire Import DivisionbyZero_proven.(* Define domain functions *)

Definition h_time (y : unit) : R := time.(* Check if at boundary )

Compute ContextualBoundary Space tt tt.

---

### Physical Model

1 - r_s / r.(* At r = r_s: boundary detected )
Lemma horizon_is_boundary :
forall r_s,
let r := r_s in
metric_component r r_s = 0.
Proof.
intro r_s. unfold metric_component.
field. ( Simplify: 1 - r_s/r_s = 0 *)
Qed.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this saying 1/0 = something?**  
A: No - it's saying the *state* at division by zero is a boundary, not a number. We don't assign a value to 1/0.

**Q: How does this differ from limits?**  
A: Limits approach from a direction. Boundaries are *at* the singularity, with context determining interpretation.

**Q: Can this resolve all singularities?**  
A: Not all - Info context still produces Undefined (true singularity). But many physical singularities can be reinterpreted.

**Q: What about 0/0?**  
A: Both numerator and denominator zero would require additional structure. Current formalization focuses on non-zero numerator.

**Q: Is this physics or mathematics?**  
A: Both - mathematical formalization of physical/philosophical insight about relational transitions.
