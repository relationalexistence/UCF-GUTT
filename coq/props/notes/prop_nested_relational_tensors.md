# Proposition — Nested Relational Tensors (Notes)

**Proof source:** [`coq/props/Prop_NestedRelationalTensors.v`](../coq/props/Prop_NestedRelationalTensors.v)  
See also base Prop 4 notes: [`notes/prop4_relational_system.md`](./prop4_relational_system.md)

## Meaning

The theorem `nested_relational_system_representation` states:

> For any valid relation \(R(x,y)\), there exists a **NestedGraph** such that  
> (i) \((x,y)\) is an edge of its **outer** graph, and  
> (ii) the **NestedAdjacencyTensor** evaluated at \((x,y)\) equals `1`.

Intuition: every binary relation can be embedded at a **top level** (outer graph) and optionally refined with **inner** graphs per edge. Even in the trivial case (no inner graph), the nested tensor reduces to the base adjacency tensor and still witnesses the relation.

## Why it matters

- **Layered structure / emergence:** Edges can carry their own internal graphs, supporting “relations within relations.” This encodes hierarchical or fractal organization (micro → meso → macro).
- **Computable semantics:** The nested tensor is a concrete, composable quantity. Analysis can sum contributions across levels for algorithms, simulations, or learning.
- **Bridge to DSoR:** Inner graphs can be annotated by multi-dimensional tensors (DSoR), marrying discrete topology (graphs) with continuous attributes.

## Implications and use-cases

- **Physics/biology/social:** Molecule bonds with quantum sub-structure; neural edges with synaptic micro-circuits; social ties with role/subgroup structure.
- **Compression & inference:** Redundant outer/inner evidence supports relational compression and multiscale inference.
- **Dynamics-ready:** With an update operator \(f\) that preserves edges, one can track nested structures through time for stability/perturbation studies.
