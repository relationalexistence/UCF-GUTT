Instead of proving something, this code formalizes definitions related to the concept of "Division by Zero as Boundary Operator":

RelationalState: Defines the possible outcomes described (normal relation, boundary case, undefined).
RelationalBoundary: Defines a function that detects the boundary condition. It checks if h y (the potential denominator) is non-zero (Rlt_dec denom 0 or Rgt_dec denom 0). If h y is zero, it returns the Boundary state. (This relies on decidable comparison for Reals).
Context: Defines labels for the different contexts you mentioned (Space, Time, Info).
ContextualBoundary: Defines a function that takes a context and applies the interpretation rules to the Boundary state. If the state is Boundary, it maps it to Related (for Space/Time) or Undefined (for Info), based on the context.
