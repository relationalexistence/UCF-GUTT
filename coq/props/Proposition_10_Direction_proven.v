  =================================
  
  PROPOSITION 10: Direction of Relation (DOR₀, DOR₁, ...) Is One Such Attribute of Relation
  
  Definition: In the "Relational System" (RS), the term "Direction of Relation" 
  (DOR) is an attribute that describes the orientation or flow of the relationship 
  between entities. The (DOR₀, DOR₁...) represents the various directional 
  relational directions of the entities within the system to self, other, system 
  internal, or to other entities or systems externally. This includes unidirectional, 
  bidirectional and multi-relational relations.
