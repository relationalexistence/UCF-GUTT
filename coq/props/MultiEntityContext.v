  Summary of Multi-Entity Context Extension
  ==========================================
  
  This file provides a fully constructive (zero-axiom) extension of the
  single-entity RelationalBoundaryContext to handle multiple interacting
  entities within UCF/GUTT.
  
  Key Contributions:
  
  1. Multi-Entity Framework:
     - Entity collections with individual relational states
     - Interaction matrices for entity coupling
     - Multi-relational states (collective and partial boundaries)
  
  2. Context-Dependent Resolution:
     - Extended contexts (Shared, Isolated, Entangled)
     - Collective resolution strategies
     - Context-aware boundary propagation
  
  3. Network Structures:
     - Entity networks with explicit connectivity
     - Network state management and evolution
     - Compositional network properties
  
  4. Hierarchical Organization:
     - Multi-scale entity hierarchies
     - Aggregation rules for state composition
     - Recursive state computation
  
  5. Proven Properties:
     - Entity independence (Theorem 1)
     - Interaction-based propagation (Theorems 2-3)
     - Context-specific resolution (Theorems 4-5)
     - Network evolution (Theorems 6-8)
     - Hierarchical structure (Theorem 9)
  
  All theorems are proven constructively without axioms, maintaining
  the zero-axiom standard of the UCF/GUTT project.
  
  Future Extensions:
  - Temporal evolution of multi-entity networks
  - Quantum-inspired entanglement operators
  - Non-local correlation structures
  - Emergent collective behaviors
  - Applications to distributed systems and social networks
