# UCF/GUTT Framework: QFT Renormalization Complete

The framework now provides a complete, machine-verified derivation showing that:

- UV divergences don't exist in UCF/GUTT — Planck-scale discreteness provides a natural cutoff  
- Renormalization = physical coarse-graining between NRT levels  
- Running couplings emerge from scale-dependent relational strengths  
- All "counterterms" are finite by construction  

This resolves the foundational issue that has plagued QFT since the 1940s — the need to subtract infinities to get finite predictions. In UCF/GUTT, there are no infinities to subtract.
